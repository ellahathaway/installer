#   Exclude the path entirely: 
#     <path> [# comment]
#   Exclude a path from a specific sdk:
#     <path>|{msft|sb} [# comment]
#   msft = Microsoft built SDK
#   sb   = source-built SDK
#
# '*' in exclusions match zero or more characters.
# '*' will match files and directory names but it will not match separator characters.
# '/' will be evaluated as '/**' if it is the last character.
#
# Examples
# 'folder/*' matches all files and directories in 'folder/'. It will not match 'folder/abc/def'
# 'folder/' is equivalent to 'folder/**. It matches 'folder/', 'folder/abc', and 'folder/abc/def/'
